  analyzeBuilding: (imageType: string, viewAngle: string) => `
You are an expert building estimator analyzing a ${imageType} image taken from a ${viewAngle} angle.

Analyze this building image and provide detailed measurements and material identification following Version 8.0 AI standards.

Required Analysis:
1. Window Detection
   - Count total windows visible
   - Estimate window dimensions (standard commercial window = 24 sq ft)
   - Identify window type (punched, ribbon, curtain wall)
   - Frame material if visible

2. Building Height
   - Count visible stories
   - Estimate height in feet (standard floor = 12 ft, first floor = 14-16 ft)
   - Note any mechanical floors or penthouses

3. Facade Materials
   - Identify all visible materials (brick, stone, concrete, EIFS, metal, glass)
   - Estimate percentage of each material
   - Note material condition and complexity

4. Ground-Level Features
   - Detect sidewalks and walkways
   - Identify covered areas (canopies, breezeways, covered walkways)
   - Count parking spaces if visible
   - Note loading docks or service areas

5. Special Considerations
   - Historic/ornate architectural features
   - Building complexity (simple/moderate/complex)
   - Obstructions blocking view
   - Confidence level for each measurement

  validateMeasurements: (measurements: any) => `
Review these building measurements for accuracy and professional estimating standards:

${JSON.stringify(measurements, null, 2)}

Validate against these criteria:
1. Glass area should not exceed 90% of total facade
2. Window count should align with glass area (รท24 sq ft per window)
3. Building height should correlate with story count (10-14 ft per story)
4. Material percentages must total 100%
5. Parking space count should align with area (270 sq ft per space)

Provide validation results and any recommended adjustments.
