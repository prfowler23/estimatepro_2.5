# EstimatePro Quality Baseline Report

**Generated**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Establish current quality metrics for systematic improvement tracking  
**Wave**: 1.2 - Quality Baseline Establishment

## 📊 **Current Quality Status**

### **Test Coverage Analysis**

```
Overall Coverage: 34.03% (CRITICAL - Below 80% target)
├── Statements:   34.03% (2,046/6,014)
├── Branches:     20.62% (538/2,609)
├── Functions:    28.85% (627/2,173)
└── Lines:        34.12% (2,020/5,920)
```

**Critical Issues Identified**:

- ❌ **Low Coverage**: 34% vs 80% target (46 point gap)
- ❌ **Branch Coverage**: 20% (insufficient edge case testing)
- ❌ **Service Coverage**: Many services have 0% coverage
- ⚠️ **Test Failures**: 8 failing tests in AI and monitoring services

### **TypeScript Compilation Status**

```
Status: FAILING (148 Type Errors)
├── Test Files: 13 errors (private method access, missing properties)
├── API Routes: 45 errors (Supabase client types, parameter types)
├── Service Layer: 67 errors (method signatures, type mismatches)
└── Infrastructure: 23 errors (query builder types, generic constraints)
```

**Critical Type Issues**:

- 🚨 **Service Layer**: Missing method signatures, private access violations
- 🚨 **API Layer**: Supabase client type mismatches, route handler signatures
- 🚨 **Database Layer**: Query builder type incompatibilities

### **Performance Baseline**

```
Database Performance: CRITICAL (0% Performance Score)
├── Sequential Scans: High (121,164 on estimation_flows)
├── Index Usage: Low (inefficient query patterns)
├── Response Times: Degraded (>3s for complex queries)
└── Optimization Status: 3 high-priority tables need immediate attention
```

**Performance Hotspots**:

- 🔥 **estimation_flows**: 121,148 sequential reads (49x more than index)
- 🔥 **estimates**: 1,564 sequential reads (34x more than index)
- 🔥 **service_rates**: 2,014 sequential reads (31x more than index)

### **Build System Analysis**

```
npm Scripts: 41 total scripts
├── Development: 4 scripts (dev, fmt, lint, typecheck)
├── Testing: 4 scripts (test suite variations)
├── Performance: 8 scripts (monitoring, optimization)
├── Security: 3 scripts (audit, enable features)
├── Production: 6 scripts (build, deploy, checks)
├── Database: 8 scripts (migrations, maintenance)
├── MCP: 2 scripts (build, start)
└── Utilities: 6 scripts (health, analysis)
```

**Build Quality Issues**:

- ⚠️ **Dependency Management**: Multiple lockfiles detected
- ⚠️ **Script Organization**: 41 scripts need categorization
- ⚠️ **Quality Gates**: Incomplete pre-commit validation

## 🎯 **Quality Improvement Targets**

### **Phase 1 Targets** (Wave 1-2)

```yaml
Test Coverage:
  Current: 34.03% → Target: 60% (+26 points)
  Priority: Core services, AI domain, estimate workflows

TypeScript:
  Current: 148 errors → Target: 0 errors
  Priority: Service layer, API routes, type definitions

Performance:
  Current: 0% score → Target: 75% score
  Priority: Database indexes, query optimization
```

### **Phase 2 Targets** (Wave 3-4)

```yaml
Test Coverage:
  Target: 60% → 80% (+20 points)
  Priority: Integration tests, edge cases, error scenarios

Performance:
  Target: 75% → 90% score
  Priority: Caching, bundle optimization, lazy loading

Build Quality:
  Target: Streamlined scripts, automated quality gates
  Priority: Developer experience, deployment reliability
```

## 🔧 **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action**

### **1. Service Layer Type Safety** (HIGH)

```typescript
Issues:
- estimate-service.ts: Missing public methods (getAllEstimates, calculateTotal)
- ai-service.ts: Missing parseBuildingAnalysis method
- monitoring-service.ts: Type mismatches in fetch operations
```

### **2. Database Performance** (CRITICAL)

```sql
Issues:
- estimation_flows: Needs covering indexes for workflow queries
- estimates: Requires optimization for list/filter operations
- service_rates: Missing indexes for rate lookups
```

### **3. Test Infrastructure** (HIGH)

```javascript
Issues:
- 8 failing tests need fixes (AI service expectations)
- Missing test coverage for 23 service files (0% coverage)
- Integration test gaps for API endpoints
```
