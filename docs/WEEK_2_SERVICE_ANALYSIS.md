- Over-engineered separation creating maintenance burden
- Circular dependencies between related services

### 3. **Performance Impact** (Medium Priority)

- Multiple service instances for same functionality
- Duplicate caching layers
- Inefficient service coordination

### 4. **Maintainability Issues** (High Priority)

- Bug fixes need to be applied to multiple places
- Testing complexity with duplicate logic
- Inconsistent patterns across similar services
