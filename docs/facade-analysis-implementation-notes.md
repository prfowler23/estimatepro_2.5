# Facade Analysis Implementation Notes

## Current Status

The facade analysis feature has been fully implemented across all phases:

1. ✅ **Phase 1-4**: Core service and API endpoints (completed in previous session)
2. ✅ **Phase 5**: Enhanced hooks with progress tracking
3. ✅ **Phase 6**: Calculator page integration
4. ✅ **Phase 7**: Comprehensive test coverage
5. ✅ **Phase 8**: Environment configuration and feature flags
6. ✅ **Phase 9**: Documentation

## Database Migration Required

The facade analysis feature requires running the database migration located at:

```
migrations/facade-analysis-schema.sql
```

This migration creates:

- `facade_analyses` table
- `facade_analysis_images` table
- Proper indexes and RLS policies

### To Apply Migration:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `migrations/facade-analysis-schema.sql`
3. Execute the SQL
4. Update TypeScript types by running: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id [your-project-id] > types/supabase.ts`

## TypeScript Type Errors

Current TypeScript errors are due to the database schema not including the facade analysis tables yet. Once the migration is applied and types are regenerated, these errors will be resolved.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:

- `/api/ai/facade-analysis/route.ts` - Main API endpoint
- `/lib/services/facade-analysis-service.ts` - Business logic
- `/components/ai/FacadeAnalysisForm.tsx` - UI component
- `/components/ai/FacadeAnalysisResults.tsx` - Results display
- `/hooks/use-facade-analysis-enhanced.ts` - React hook

- `/__tests__/facade-analysis.test.tsx` - Component tests
- `/__tests__/facade-analysis-service.test.ts` - Service tests
- `/__tests__/use-facade-analysis.test.tsx` - Hook tests

### Modified Files:

- `lib/calculations/constants.ts` - Added FACADE_ANALYSIS service type
- `lib/constants/services.ts` - Added service definition
- `components/calculator/service-calculator.tsx` - Added service card

## Next Steps

1. Apply database migration
2. Regenerate TypeScript types
3. Test the feature end-to-end
4. Deploy to production with feature flag enabled
