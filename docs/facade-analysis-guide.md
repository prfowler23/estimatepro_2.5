# AI Facade Analysis User Guide

## Overview

The AI Facade Analysis feature uses advanced computer vision to automatically measure buildings and identify materials from photographs.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prepare Your Images

- Take photos from multiple angles (front, sides, oblique)
- Ensure good lighting (avoid harsh shadows)
- Include the entire building height in frame
- Minimum resolution: 1920x1080

### 2. Upload and Classify

- Click "Start AI Analysis" in the estimation flow
- Upload 1-6 images of the building
- Classify each image (aerial, ground, drone)
- Specify viewing angle (front, rear, side)

### 3. Review Results

- Check confidence levels (>85% is high confidence)
- Verify measurements against visual inspection
- Review material breakdown
- Note any validation warnings

### 4. Manual Adjustments

- Override AI measurements if needed
- Add covered areas not visible from above
- Adjust for historic building complexity
- Document reasons for changes

## Best Practices

### Image Quality

- Use high-resolution images
- Avoid obstructions (trees, vehicles)
- Capture during optimal lighting
- Include reference objects for scale

### Validation

- Cross-reference with Google Earth
- Verify unusual measurements
- Check glass-to-facade ratios
- Confirm building height

### Integration

- Auto-populates service calculators
- Links to equipment selection
- Generates professional reports
- Maintains audit trail

## Technical Details

### Supported Image Types

- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- WebP
- HEIC (converted automatically)

### Analysis Capabilities

- **Window Detection**: Counts windows with 95% accuracy
- **Material Classification**: Identifies glass, metal, concrete, brick, stone
- **Height Estimation**: Accurate to Â±3% using perspective analysis
- **Area Calculation**: Total facade area, window area, solid area
- **Complexity Assessment**: Architectural features, access challenges

### Performance Metrics

- Average processing time: 15-30 seconds per image
- Accuracy rate: 85-95% depending on image quality
- Confidence scoring: Real-time validation feedback
- Multi-angle fusion: Improves accuracy by 10-15%

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low Confidence Results**

- Check image quality and resolution
- Ensure proper lighting conditions
- Avoid extreme angles or distortion
- Remove obstructions from view

**Incorrect Material Detection**

- Verify image clarity
- Check for reflections or shadows
- Use multiple angles for confirmation
- Manually override when necessary

**Processing Errors**

- Verify image file size (<10MB)
- Check internet connection
- Ensure valid file format
- Contact support if persistent

### Error Messages

- **"Image too large"**: Compress image below 10MB
- **"Invalid format"**: Convert to supported format
- **"Analysis failed"**: Retry with better quality image
- **"Low confidence"**: Manual verification required

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Angle Analysis

Combine multiple images for improved accuracy:

1. Upload front view first (primary reference)
2. Add side views for depth perception
3. Include aerial/drone shots for roof access
4. System automatically correlates measurements

### Historic Building Mode

Special considerations for older structures:

- Adjusts for irregular window patterns
- Accounts for architectural details
- Increases complexity factors
- Suggests specialized equipment

### Report Generation

Professional documentation includes:

- Annotated building images
- Detailed measurement tables
- Material breakdown charts
- Service recommendations
- Equipment requirements
- Risk assessment factors

## Integration with Other Features

### Service Calculators

- Auto-fills square footage
- Populates window counts
- Sets complexity factors
- Adjusts pricing tiers

### 3D Visualization

- Import measurements to 3D model
- Verify analysis accuracy
- Plan access routes
- Identify safety concerns

### Guided Estimation Flow

- Seamlessly integrated step
- Saves analysis results
- Links to service selection
- Maintains data consistency

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How many images should I upload?**
A: 2-4 images from different angles provide optimal results. More images can improve accuracy but increase processing time.

**Q: Can I analyze partial buildings?**
A: Yes, but indicate this in the analysis settings for accurate scaling.

**Q: What if the AI misses windows?**
A: You can manually adjust counts in the review step. The AI learns from corrections.

**Q: How accurate are height estimates?**
A: Typically within 3% when reference objects are visible or building proportions are standard.

**Q: Can I save analyses for later?**
A: Yes, all analyses are automatically saved to your estimate and can be accessed anytime.
