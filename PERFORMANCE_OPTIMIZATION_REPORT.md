# Performance Optimization Report

## Initial Analysis

### Bundle Size Issues Identified:

- **Client bundles**: Up to 912KB for single chunks
- **Server bundles**: Up to 2.0MB per chunk
- **Main issues**: Heavy dependencies loaded upfront (Three.js, PDF libraries, UI components)

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Bundle Analysis Setup ✅

- Installed webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Added `npm run analyze` script
- Identified largest chunks for optimization

### 2. Performance Monitoring ✅

- Added Web Vitals tracking (CLS, LCP, INP, FCP, TTFB)
- Created performance metrics hook
- Integrated into app layout for continuous monitoring

### 3. Lazy Loading Implementation ✅

#### Three.js Components

- Created `LazyBuilding3D` wrapper
- Disabled SSR for 3D components
- Expected savings: ~500KB from initial bundle

#### PDF Libraries

- Created `LazyPDFService` for on-demand loading
- Lazy load jsPDF and related dependencies
- Expected savings: ~300KB from initial bundle

#### Calculator Forms

- Already implemented lazy loading
- 11 calculator forms load on-demand

### 4. UI Improvements ✅

- Enhanced dashboard skeleton loaders
- Better perceived performance during load
- Reduced layout shift

### 5. Code Splitting Strategy ✅

#### Created Optimization Utilities:

- `lazy-imports.ts` - Centralized lazy loading
- `optimized-app-providers.tsx` - Lazy loaded providers
- `next.config.performance.mjs` - Advanced splitting config

#### Chunk Splitting Configuration:

```javascript
{
  three: "Three.js and 3D libraries",
  pdf: "PDF generation libraries",
  ui: "Radix UI and Framer Motion",
  charts: "Recharts and D3",
  forms: "React Hook Form and Zod",
  vendor: "Other node_modules",
  common: "Shared modules"
}
```

## Performance Improvements Expected

### Initial Bundle Size

- **Before**: ~5MB total
- **After**: ~2-3MB (40-50% reduction)

### Time Metrics

- **Time to Interactive**: 5-8s → <3s
- **First Contentful Paint**: 2-3s → <1s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: Better with skeletons

### Loading Strategy

1. Critical path: Theme, Auth, Core UI
2. Deferred: Heavy libraries, Non-critical providers
3. On-demand: Calculators, 3D, PDF generation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. Deploy changes and measure real-world impact
2. Monitor Web Vitals in production
3. Set up performance budgets

### Future Optimizations:

1. Implement service worker for offline caching
2. Add resource hints (preconnect, prefetch)
3. Optimize images with next/image
4. Consider CDN for static assets
5. Implement React Server Components for heavy pages

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track:

- Bundle sizes per route
- Core Web Vitals scores
- JavaScript execution time
- Network waterfall timing

### Tools:

- Web Vitals Reporter (integrated)
- Bundle Analyzer (npm run analyze)
- Chrome DevTools Performance
- Lighthouse CI (recommended)

## Performance Budget Recommendations

### Bundle Sizes:

- Main bundle: <100KB
- Route bundles: <200KB
- Total initial JS: <500KB

### Timing:

- FCP: <1.8s
- LCP: <2.5s
- TTI: <3.8s
- CLS: <0.1

## Conclusion

The implemented optimizations focus on reducing initial bundle size through lazy loading and code splitting. The next phase should focus on runtime performance and caching strategies.
