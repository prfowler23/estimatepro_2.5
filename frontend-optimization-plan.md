# Week 4: Frontend Optimization & User Experience Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on build analysis, EstimatePro has 70+ warnings related to React hooks, image optimization, and bundle size. This plan addresses frontend performance, user experience, and developer experience improvements.

## Current State Analysis

### Build Warnings Identified (70+ warnings)

- **React Hooks Issues**: Missing dependencies, complex expressions in dependency arrays
- **Image Optimization**: Usage of `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image />` component
- **Bundle Optimization**: Anonymous default exports affecting tree shaking
- **Performance**: useEffect with missing dependencies causing unnecessary re-renders

### Service Consolidation Impact

- ✅ Services reduced: 58→15 (70% reduction)
- ✅ Import paths simplified through unified services
- ✅ Build time improved due to fewer service files

### Current Frontend Assets

- 11 Service calculators with lazy loading
- 15 AI-powered endpoints
- 3D visualization system
- Drone integration platform
- PWA capabilities
- Mobile-first design system
