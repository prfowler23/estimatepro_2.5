## Performance Bottlenecks Analysis

### High-Frequency Updates

Services updating faster than 100ms require immediate optimization with debouncing or throttling.

### State Management Issues

0 files have state management issues requiring optimization.

### Memory Usage Concerns

7 services have elevated memory usage requiring optimization.

## Optimization Strategies

### Caching Implementation

#### Temporal Caching

- **Use Case**: Real-time pricing calculations
- **Implementation**: Redis with short TTL (100-1000ms)

#### Delta Compression

- **Use Case**: Complex state objects with partial updates
- **Implementation**: Track and transmit only changed properties

#### Sliding Window

- **Use Case**: Pricing history and trend analysis
- **Implementation**: Maintain fixed-size buffer with oldest data expiration

## Implementation Plan

### Critical Performance Fixes (Week 1)

**Priority**: critical
**Impact**: 40-60% performance improvement for critical services

- Implement debouncing for high-frequency updates (<100ms)
- Add memory leak fixes for unbounded arrays and timers
- Optimize state management in complex components
- Add rate limiting to prevent performance degradation

### Caching & Connection Optimization (Week 2-3)

**Priority**: high
**Impact**: 25-40% additional performance improvement

- Implement temporal caching for real-time pricing
- Add delta compression for state updates
- Optimize WebSocket connection management
- Implement sliding window caches for time-series data

### Advanced Optimizations (Week 4-5)

**Priority**: medium
**Impact**: 15-25% additional optimization plus monitoring

- Add predictive prefetching for user workflows
- Implement advanced memory optimization strategies
- Set up real-time performance monitoring
- Fine-tune auto-save frequencies based on user patterns

## Performance Targets

### Response Time Goals

- **Real-Time Pricing**: Target: <50ms calculation time
- **Session Recovery**: Target: <200ms recovery initialization
- **Auto-Save**: Target: <100ms save operation

### Memory Optimization

- **Target**: Reduce memory usage by 30% through optimization
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for >10MB per real-time service

### Caching Performance

- **Hit Ratio**: Target: >80% cache hit ratio for pricing calculations
- **Latency**: Target: <10ms cache retrieval time

## Success Metrics

- **Real-time responsiveness**: <100ms for pricing calculations
- **Memory efficiency**: 30% reduction in memory usage
- **Cache effectiveness**: >80% hit ratio for frequent operations
- **System stability**: Zero memory leaks in production
- **User experience**: Sub-second auto-save and session recovery

## Next Steps

1. Implement critical fixes for high-frequency update services
2. Deploy temporal caching for real-time pricing calculations
3. Add comprehensive memory leak prevention
4. Set up real-time performance monitoring and alerting
