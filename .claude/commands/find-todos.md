# Find TODOs

I'll locate all TODO comments and unfinished work markers in your codebase.

First, let me scan for various TODO patterns:

```bash
# Common TODO patterns across different languages
echo "Searching for TODOs, FIXMEs, and other markers..."

# Count different types based on project structure
echo "Analyzing codebase for markers..."

# Results will be shown after analysis
```

I'll search for these patterns:

- **TODO/Todo/todo**: General tasks to complete
- **FIXME/Fixme/fixme**: Known issues that need fixing
- **HACK/Hack/hack**: Temporary workarounds
- **XXX**: Warnings or problematic code
- **NOTE/Note**: Important notes that might indicate incomplete work
- Various comment styles based on your project's languages

For each marker found, I'll show:

1. **File location** with line number
2. **The full comment** with context
3. **Surrounding code** to understand what needs to be done
4. **Priority assessment** based on the marker type

I'll organize findings by:

- **Critical** (FIXME, HACK, XXX): Issues that could cause problems
- **Important** (TODO): Features or improvements needed
- **Informational** (NOTE): Context that might need attention

I'll also identify:

- TODOs that reference missing implementations
- Placeholder code that needs replacement
- Incomplete error handling
- Stubbed functions awaiting implementation

This helps you track and prioritize unfinished work in your codebase.
