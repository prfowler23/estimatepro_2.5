# Auto Format Code

I'll format your code using the project's configured formatter.

First, let me check if this project has a formatter configured by analyzing:

- Configuration files in the project root
- Build or task runner setups
- Editor configuration files
- Code style definitions

Based on what I find, I'll determine the appropriate formatting approach for your project.

I'll format only the files that have been modified to:

- Avoid unnecessary changes
- Keep the formatting focused
- Prevent touching vendor/dependency directories

After formatting, I'll show you what changed.

If no formatter is found:

- I'll list what I searched for
- Suggest popular formatters for your project type
- Ask if you'd like me to format manually using language conventions

If formatting fails:

- I'll show the exact error
- Explain what might be wrong
- Suggest fixes or alternatives

This ensures consistent code style according to your project's standards.
