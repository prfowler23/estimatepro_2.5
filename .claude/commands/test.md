# Smart Test Runner

I'll run the tests for this project and help with any failures.

First, let me check if this project has tests configured:

I'll analyze:

- The project structure for test patterns
- Configuration files that might define test commands
- Common test directory names
- Files with test-related naming patterns
- Build or task runner configurations

Based on what I discover about your project, I'll identify how to run the tests.

After running the tests, I'll:

1. Parse any failures
2. Show you the specific errors
3. Explain what's wrong
4. Suggest how to fix them

If tests fail due to missing dependencies or configuration issues, I'll help identify and resolve those problems.

If no tests are found:

- I'll list all the patterns I searched for
- Show the project structure I analyzed
- Ask if tests exist in a non-standard location
- Offer to help set up a testing framework if needed

If I can't run the tests:

- I'll show the exact command that failed
- Explain possible reasons (missing deps, wrong command)
- Suggest fixes based on the error

My goal is to help you understand and fix test failures, not to hide them by changing assertions.
