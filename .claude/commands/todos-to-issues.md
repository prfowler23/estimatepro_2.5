# TODOs to GitHub Issues

I'll scan your codebase for TODO comments and create GitHub issues automatically.

First, let me check if this is a GitHub repository and we have the necessary tools:

```bash
# Check if we're in a git repository with GitHub remote
if ! git remote -v | grep -q github.com; then
    echo "Error: No GitHub remote found"
    echo "This command requires a GitHub repository"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for gh CLI
if ! command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: GitHub CLI (gh) not found"
    echo "Install from: https://cli.github.com"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify authentication
if ! gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
    echo "Error: Not authenticated with GitHub"
    echo "Run: gh auth login"
    exit 1
fi
```

Now I'll scan for TODO patterns in your code and analyze their context.

When I find multiple TODOs, I'll create a todo list to track which ones have been converted to issues.

For each TODO found, I'll:

1. Extract the comment content and surrounding code
2. Create a descriptive issue title
3. Include file location and context
4. Add appropriate labels
5. Create the issue on GitHub

I'll handle rate limits and show you a summary of all created issues.

This helps convert your development notes into trackable work items.
