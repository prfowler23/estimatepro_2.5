- Progressive component loading
- Improved perceived performance
- Better mobile performance
- Reduced data usage

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Tree-Shaking Configuration

```javascript
modularizeImports: {
  "lucide-react": {
    transform: "lucide-react/icons/{{member}}",
  },
  "date-fns": {
    transform: "date-fns/{{member}}",
  },
  "lodash": {
    transform: "lodash/{{member}}",
  },
}
```

### Lazy Loading Pattern

```typescript
export const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("@/components/path"));

// With loading skeleton
<Suspense fallback={<ComponentLoader />}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

### Smart Navigation Integration

```typescript
const { navigate: smartNavigate } = useSmartNavigation({
  enablePrefetch: true,
  enablePrediction: true,
  enableMetrics: true,
});
```
