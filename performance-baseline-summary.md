# EstimatePro Performance Baseline Report

**Generated**: 8/8/2025, 12:17:30 AM

## Executive Summary

- **Total Services Analyzed**: 55
- **Total Bundle Size**: 7566.1KB
- **Average Service Complexity**: 44.6
- **Estimated Memory Footprint**: 5.44MB
- **High Risk Services**: 2
- **Optimization Opportunities**: 115

## Performance Targets

Based on baseline analysis, we recommend the following performance targets:

- **API Response Time**: <200ms (current avg: 294.90909090909093ms)
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial load (current: 7566.1KB)
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB on mobile (current estimate: 5.44MB)

## Top Optimization Recommendations

1. **lib** (medium priority)
   - Issue: Large bundle size (3423.4KB)
   - Recommendation: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Impact: 20-40% bundle size reduction
   - Effort: medium

2. **components** (medium priority)
   - Issue: Large bundle size (3129.6KB)
   - Recommendation: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Impact: 20-40% bundle size reduction
   - Effort: medium

3. **app** (medium priority)
   - Issue: Large bundle size (744.0KB)
   - Recommendation: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Impact: 20-40% bundle size reduction
   - Effort: medium

4. **hooks** (medium priority)
   - Issue: Large bundle size (255.2KB)
   - Recommendation: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Impact: 20-40% bundle size reduction
   - Effort: medium

5. **Query patterns** (high priority)
   - Issue: 1 potential N+1 query patterns detected
   - Recommendation: Implement query consolidation and eager loading
   - Impact: 50-80% database query performance improvement
   - Effort: high

## Implementation Roadmap

### Quick Wins (Week 1-2)

**Focus**: Low effort, high impact optimizations

- Implement caching for high-frequency API endpoints
- Add lazy loading for large components
- Optimize database query patterns in top 3 services

### Service Optimization (Week 3-4)

**Focus**: High-complexity service refactoring

- Break down services with complexity > 100
- Implement service-level caching strategies
- Add performance monitoring and alerting

### Bundle Optimization (Week 5-6)

**Focus**: Code splitting and bundle size reduction

- Implement dynamic imports for large modules
- Optimize webpack configuration
- Add bundle analysis monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Review and validate baseline measurements
2. Set up continuous performance monitoring
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Establish performance regression testing
